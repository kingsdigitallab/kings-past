Law LLB student</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-3v65fo">Imagine rushing through Aldwych, maybe to a seminar or a lecture, but among the plaques and full-body statues that line the diplomatic institutions from Australia House to the Royal Courts of Justice, you notice a bust etched in stone towering over you.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1vne6wr">Unlike many monuments in the area that emphasize remarkably similar individuals as heroes, this one stands out: blending motifs of military, racial, and medical histories in memorial to James Africanus Horton, one of Britain’s first Black physicians and regarded as the Father of African Political Thought. His service to the British Army spanned multiple continents over many years, in which he contributed to the understanding of tropical botany, disease, and remedies, including some of the earliest recordings and investigations of sickle cell anaemia. As intriguing as his repertoire is, what is far more intriguing is that this monument does not exist, not in Aldwych, not anywhere!</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-299aww">Despite his temporal distance, James Africanus Horton stands as a profound touchstone for the complexities of the Black identity, embodying the intricate contrasts and contradictions that defined his life and work. This article will consider his unique positioning and cultural hybridity using the themes of religion and education, Creole identity, military engagement and finally, the formulation of a personal politic in early Africana philosophy.</p> <h2 id="religion-and-education" data-svelte-h="svelte-yymy22">Religion and Education</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-977lhg">James was born in 1835 to a family of devout Christian recaptives living in Gloucester, Sierra Leone. He was educated in mission schools, including the renowned Fourah Bay Institute, heightening his exposure to Western value systems of civility. As such, he was steeped in the religious doctrines of his time. Horton’s name itself—James Africanus Beale Horton—echoed this duality, blending African pride with a European assimilation, encapsulating the symbiosis between his African roots and his colonial education. He went on to attend King’s College London, where daily prayer was a part of the curriculum, yet he systematically refuted the racist ideologies inherent to the very religion that continually shaped his education.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-utdlcq">London in the late 19th century saw an uptick in racial curiosity, particularly among scientists at the institutions James worked at: the emergence of early ethnologists and anthropologists divided over the classification of humankind as a single species or separate species welcomed a slew of racist hypothesizing. In tandem, there are Select Committee reports referenced as questioning the ability of Africans to self-govern, prompting his landmark work West African Countries and Peoples, British and Native And a Vindication of the African Race (1868). Although the Anthropological Society would later be absorbed into the Royal Anthropological Society, its impact is evident even in James Horton’s political philosophy as he maintains a similar typification of societies into savage, semi-barbarous and civilized, as would later be formalized by Edward B. Tylor in 1871.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-sfkjgp">His work is also reflective of the racial typification that pervaded scientific spaces at the time: despite his dissent concerning the ability of African people to self-govern, he emphasized religion, education and the need for a civilizing force in Africa, which would later be corroborated by members of the Anthropological Society he refuted, who declared ‘Christianity, the surest way to civilisation’. Despite this, Horton’s intellectual pursuits were a direct challenge to the Eurocentric beliefs that regarded Africans as inferior, as he fiercely argued for the capability and right of Africans to self-govern.</p> <h2 id="the-hybridity-of-creole-identity" data-svelte-h="svelte-19fwdy0">The Hybridity of Creole Identity</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1cner9y">Horton was a Creole, a member of a community often overlooked in the racial binaries of his era, existing in a society that largely ignored the complexities of African identities. As such, his life was a testament to navigating this liminal space—neither fully identifying culturally with the European colonizers nor completely aligned with the indigenous African populations. In this, Horton represented the duality of traversing two worlds, yet fully belonging to neither, constantly at the crossroads of cultural identities and clashes.</p> <h2 id="an-african-doctor-in-the-british-army" data-svelte-h="svelte-v1vh94">An African Doctor in the British Army</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-7ktf4i">His career as a military doctor further reinforced this paradox. The role itself—a healer within the military—was an oxymoron, compounded by the racial dynamics of the time. Horton likely attended to white soldiers who viewed him with suspicion or outright disdain, despite relying on his medical expertise. His presence in the British Army highlighted the contradictions of colonialism, where a Black man could be a saviour and a subordinate in the same breath.</p> <h2 id="a-pioneer-of-africana-philosophy" data-svelte-h="svelte-3pjkrf">A Pioneer of ‘Africana’ Philosophy</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-10u1s1w">Horton’s intellectual legacy is marked by his rigorous refutation of the eugenics that underpinned colonial rule. He was a scholar who deconstructed the pseudo-scientific racism of his time, yet his politics were paradoxically aligned with the idea of European “civilizing” influence. He stood at the intersection of advocating for African self-governance while also engaging with the colonial structures that sought to oppress his people. Horton’s life was a navigation of these crossroads—between Freetown’s legal trade and the lingering shadow of the slave trade, between national pride and the eugenicist ideologies of colonization, between the roles of caretaker and soldier.</p> <h2 id="a-lasting-legacy" data-svelte-h="svelte-157k1fm">A Lasting Legacy</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-j5a3dl">James Africanus Horton’s legacy of profound complexity still rings true today: a man of contrasts, embodying the tensions and dualities of Black identity in a colonial world. His life and work serve as a reminder of the intricate, constantly conflicting forces that shape the journey toward continental, national, and individual self-determination, standing as a touchstone for the layered realities of Black existence in the face of systemic oppression.</p> <h2 id="sources" data-svelte-h="svelte-1qs97oq">Sources</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-6t9ew5">King, Anthony, ‘Decolonizing the British Army: a preliminary response’, <em>International Affairs</em>, 97, 2, (2021), 443–461.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-8no9w9">Campbell, G., ‘On the Races of India as Traced in Existing Tribes and Castes’, _The Journal of the Ethnological Society of London (1869-1870), 1(2), (1869), 128–140.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ym3lxa">Horton, J.

He is among the commanders who won and ended the Napoleonic Wars when the Seventh Coalition defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Bborn in the Kingdom of Ireland into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family, belonging to the Protestant Ascendancy, beginning life as The Hon. Arthur Wesley. Wellesley was born the son of Anne, Countess of Mornington, and Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington. His father was himself the son of Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington, and had a short career in politics representing the constituency of Trim in the Irish House of Commons before succeeding his father as Baron Mornington in 1758. Garret Mornington was also an accomplished composer, and in recognition of his musical and philanthropic achievements was elevated to the rank of Earl of Mornington in 1760.Wellesley's mother was the eldest daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon, after whom Wellesley was named. His term as prime minister was marked by Roman Catholic Emancipation: the restoration of most civil rights to Roman Catholics in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The change was prompted by the landslide by-election win of Daniel O'Connell, a Roman Catholic Irish proponent of emancipation, who was elected despite not being legally allowed to sit in Parliament. In the House of Lords, facing stiff opposition, Wellington spoke for Catholic Emancipation, and according to some sources, gave one of the best speeches of his career. Wellington was born in Ireland and so had some understanding of the grievances of the Roman Catholic majority there; as Chief Secretary, he had given an undertaking that the remaining Penal Laws would only be enforced as \"mildly\" as possible. In 1811 Catholic soldiers were given freedom of worship and 18 years later the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 was passed with a majority of 105. Many Tories voted against the Act, and it passed only with the help of the Whigs. Wellington had threatened to resign as prime minister if King George IV did not give Royal Assent. The nickname \"Iron Duke\" originated from this period, when he experienced a high degree of personal and political unpopularity. During this time, Wellington was greeted by a hostile reaction from the crowds at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Wellington was gradually superseded as leader of the Tories by Robert Peel, while the party evolved into the Conservatives. When the Tories were returned to power in 1834, Wellington declined to become prime minister because he thought membership in the House of Commons had become essential. The king reluctantly approved Peel, who was in Italy.In 1824, one liaison came back to haunt him, when Wellington received a letter from a publisher, John Joseph Stockdale, offering to refrain from issuing an edition of the rather racy memoirs of one of his mistresses, Harriette Wilson, in exchange for money. It is said that the Duke promptly returned the letter, after scrawling across it, \"Publish and be damned\". However, Hibbert notes in his biography that the letter can be found among the Duke's papers, with nothing written on it. It is certain that Wellington did reply, and the tone of a further letter from the publisher, quoted by Longford, suggests that he had refused in the strongest language to submit to blackmail.",created_at:"2024-02-29T11:40:24.882143+00:00",gender:"Assigned male at birth",language:"English",nationality:"United Kingdom",ethnicity:"White",ethnicity_description:null,nationality_description:"Wellesley was born into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family.",draft:true,added_by:"Gillian Lamb",person_moment:[{moment:"2- 1828: The financial and political networks which created King's"}]},{id:287,name:"Earl Brownlow",slug:"earl-brownlow-287",alternative_names:"John Cust",description:"The eldest son of the 1st Baron of Brownlow, elected MP for Clitheroe in 1802 after his tour of Russia and Germany in 1801.

He is regarded as the father of modern British policing, owing to his founding of the Metropolitan Police Service. Peel was one of the founders of the modern Conservative Party.The son of a wealthy textile manufacturer and politician, Peel was the first prime minister from an industrial business background. He earned a double first in classics and mathematics from Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the House of Commons in 1809 and became a rising star in the Tory Party. Peel entered the Cabinet as home secretary (1822–1827), where he reformed and liberalised the criminal law and created the modern police force, leading to a new type of officer known in tribute to him as \"bobbies\" and \"peelers\". After a brief period out of office he returned as home secretary under his political mentor the Duke of Wellington (1828–1830), also serving as Leader of the House of Commons. Initially, a supporter of continued legal discrimination against Catholics, Peel reversed himself and supported the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 and the 1828 repeal of the Test Act, claiming that \"though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger\".Peel often started from a traditional Tory position in opposition to a measure, then reversed his stance and became the leader in supporting liberal legislation. This happened with the Test Act, Catholic emancipation, the Reform Act, income tax and, most notably, the repeal of the Corn Laws. Historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote: \"Peel was in the first rank of 19th-century statesmen. He carried Catholic Emancipation; he repealed the Corn Laws; he created the modern Conservative Party on the ruins of the old Toryism. Peel was born at Chamber Hall, Bury, Lancashire, to the industrialist and parliamentarian Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, and his wife Ellen Yates. His father was one of the richest textile manufacturers of the early Industrial Revolution. Peel received his early education from a clergyman tutor in Bury and at a clergyman's local school in Tamworth.He may also have attended Bury Grammar School or Hipperholme Grammar School, though evidence for either is anecdotal rather than textual. He started at Harrow School in February 1800. At Harrow, he was a contemporary of Lord Byron. Attended Christ Church, Oxford, which Peel attended 1805–1808, graduating with a double first. In 1805, Peel matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. His tutor was Charles Lloyd, later Regius Professor of Divinity, on Peel's recommendation appointed bishop of Oxford.

When Barrington was translated to Durham, Burgess followed and was rewarded with the first available prebendall stall. Days after obtaining his DD, Burgess' old school and university peer P.M.

Cotton was a merchant, inventor, banker, and philanthropist, who during his lifetime built numerous churches and schools for the working classes. Cotton came from a well-established upper middle-class family. His father (Joseph Cotton, 1745-1825) had made his money as a captain for the East India Company (EIC) taking advantage of expanding imperial trade and was later appointed a director of the EIC. His grandfather (Dr Nathaniel Cotton, 1705-1788) was a highly respected physician.  Cotton was a deeply religious man and during his lifetime was involved with societies such as the Colonial Bishoprics Fund, Hackney Phalanx of Prominent Churchmen and Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. Cotton believed that moral reform was the best form of patriotism. Importantly, he argued that the poor needed to be relieved of their poverty before their morals could be judged. His philanthropy therefore focused on the promotion of institutions that could relieve economic and social pressures. This included his zeal for building churches, promoting public baths, wash houses and model lodging houses.  \n\nHowever, Cotton’s behaviour was not always so exemplary. During his time at Chigwell Grammar, 15-year-old Cotton was accused of setting fire to the headmaster’s garden. Cotton married Sarah Fowler in 1812. The couple had seven children together and Cotton maintained a keen interest in their upbringing and education. Reflecting both his business shrewdness and his familial shipping legacy, Cotton first began his career at the Limehouse shipping firm Huddart & Co. which he later adopted full control of, he also invented steam driven rope making machinery and in 1851 was awarded the Telford Medal from the Institution of Civil Engineers. During his tenure at the Bank of England, Cotton alongside Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel and Conservative plantation owner, Henry Goulburn, produced the Bank Charter Act of 1844. One of his most valued inventions was an automatic weighing machine for sovereigns, colloquially referred to as ‘the governor’, which won a medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and was used extensively at the Bank of England. William Cotton became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1821, was elected chairman of the London Hospital in 1827 and became treasurer in 1837 echoing some of the roles he undertook for the newly founded King’s College London in 1829. He also used the many connections he made through these roles to fundraise for King’s College London. However, the man he had the most contact with at King’s was his friend Henry Nelson Coleridge, who was also an important council member.
