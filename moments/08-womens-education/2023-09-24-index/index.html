  <h1>Women’s education</h1>
  <article>
<p>King’s Ladies Department opened in 1885 with the aim of providing female students ‘with a castle of their own’. Its foundation came at a moment at which the expansion of women’s higher education was accelerating within leading universities, but which remained highly unequal to that available to men. King’s Ladies Department created a space to expand not only women’s access to higher education, but one in which the fraught gender politics of the late-nineteenth century accelerated. Many King’s graduates became active members of the suffrage movement, as well as taking up professional careers in the institutions of a nascent welfare state, as teachers, nurses, hygienists. Others went on to build celebrated academic careers. Mixed undergraduate teaching arrived in 1915, when women started to attend the Strand campus. This research will explore what the emergence of first women’s and then co-education looked like in King’s, charting both new opportunities and ongoing systemic barriers to full inclusion. It will examine debates around women’s education at King’s to shed new light on the college’s transition to a fully co-educational institution in the first half of the twentieth century.</p>
