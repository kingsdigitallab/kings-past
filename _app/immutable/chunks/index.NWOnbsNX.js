In terms of teaching, they were structured to provide training and generate new knowledge for those contemplating careers in India and the wider empire, while several of the fellowship transferred directly from working for the expanding imperial state to teaching in Higher Education (and vice versa). The EIC made a donation to King’s upon its founding and continued support into the 1850s.
