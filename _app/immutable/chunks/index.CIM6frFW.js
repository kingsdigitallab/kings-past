By the late-nineteenth century, the college had become one of the leading centres of scientific and medical research in the world. Work and education undertaken at King’s was notable for linking theoretical and practical concerns. Prominent scientists and medical figures based at King’s, like James Clerk Maxwell and Joseph Lister, became renowned in their fields and associated with innovative techniques and concepts. King’s research had practical application across the empire in fields as diverse as battlefield medicine, tropical diseases, nuclear physics, railway engineering, and colonial irrigation. This was especially notable in geology, where academics based at King’s, like Charles Lyell, David T. Ansted and Harry Govier Seeley simultaneously promoted new understandings of the history and structure of the earth, while furthering the exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. And in scientific and medical education, King’s pioneered new training practices and organization, with an especially notable example being the nursing school established by Florence Nightingale at St Thomas’ Hospital in 1860 (the forerunner of the current King’s Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care).
