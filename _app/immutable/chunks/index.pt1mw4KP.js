This provided both employment for former students and opportunities to expand the university’s teaching. Engineering, Military Studies, Oriental Languages, and Law all had close connections to the East India Company. In terms of teaching, they were structured to provide training and generate new knowledge for those contemplating careers in India and the wider empire, while several of the fellowship transferred directly from working for the expanding imperial state to teaching in Higher Education (and vice versa). The East India Company made a donation to King’s upon its founding and continued support into the 1850s. King’s continued to supply officials and etchnical experts to various branches of the Indian Civil Service throughout the second half of the nineteenth century and a growing number to the Colonial Service during the twentieth century. Dozens of engineers were recruited from the King’s Department of Applied Science to the imperial Indian engineering service, for example. Involvement in the training and supply of imperial recruits shaped the college’s academic portfolio. As part of the University of London, the college continued to deliver pre-deployment training and used this commitment to appoint new chairs and lecturers in fields relevant to empire, including civil engineering, history and Asian languages.",a,i,t='<h2 id="kings-future-kings-careers">King’s future.
