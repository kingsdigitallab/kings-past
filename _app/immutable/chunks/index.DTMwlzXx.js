In terms of teaching, they were structured to provide training and generate new knowledge for those contemplating careers in India and the wider empire, while several of the fellowship transferred directly from working for the expanding imperial state to teaching in Higher Education (and vice versa). The EIC made a donation to King’s upon its founding and continued support into the 1850s. King’s continued to supply officials to various branches of the Indian Civil Service throughout the second half of the nineteenth century and a growing number to the Colonial Service during the twentieth century.
