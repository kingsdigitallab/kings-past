Christopher Monro, a KCL porter, pointed out in a letter responding to faculty support of the NUS decision  that whole non-violent members of the conservative party and National Front had been interrupted, IRA sympathisers had been allowed to speak on campus without interruption: ‘did any of the students and  their contemporaries who tried to  suppress the National Front procession on 15th June lift a finger or a whisper to against the militant fenian one of the 9th?’.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> This conflation of freedom fighters with English far right movements like the National Front, a pro-apartheid and anti-immigration evolution of the League of Empire Loyalists was the intellectual basis of many arguments opposing the NUS’s stance. An open letter from Engineering faculty members would write in the same publication after setting Che Guevara in contrast with the National Front: ‘Until the NUS gives assurances by its actions that it is prepared to be fair-minded in its approach to these problems then we can only regard it as a political and doctrinaire forum rather than an academic association, whose outlook on this matter, in its sanctimonious hypocrisy, is merely contemptible’.<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> While the NUS policy generated national controversy, King’s students seemed to avoid using this strategy, as the Conservative association would write: ‘Thank God for King’s bastion of sanity and moderation in these matters. Perhaps one member of the Labour Club who was present and who recently stood in an election at a UGM meeting on a no platform ticket might be moved to rethink her views on the fundamental rights of free speech, on which the quality of our life depends’.<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup>',s,d,E='This debate on whether an institution lends credibility to harmful ideology by hosting speakers who espouse hate and racism continues today.
