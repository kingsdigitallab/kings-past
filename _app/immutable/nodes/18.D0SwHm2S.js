A Department of Military Science was first formed in 1848 amid fears of revolution and war across Europe. It provided general education and technical training for those who aspired to become officers in the British and East India Company armies. The course consisted of three parts: 1. divinity; 2. history, languages, mathematics, and natural philosophy; 3. military strategy, tactics, fortifications, and surveying. After 1859, military studies and science were merged into teaching under the Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Engineering. There was less vocational teaching, but King’s still contributed significant research that underpinned Britain’s expanding military and imperial strength in the period before 1914. In 1927, the War Office supported the foundation of a Military Studies Department at King’s, which became the Department of War Studies in 1943, operating until 1948. Now with a more global focus, King’s became a research and teaching centre that drew students, researchers, and state interest from across the globe. The current War Studies Department was set up in 1962, during the height of the Cold War, under the leadership of Sir Michael Howard.

But on a global scale, the war and its aftermath were a dramatic period of imperial collapse. As empires that had dominated Eurasia for centuries—Romanov, Habsburg, Ottoman—disappeared, new landscapes of nation-states slowly and contentiously emerged. King’s played an important role in both of the reconfiguration of the British empire and the quest for a post-imperial models elsewhere in the world. Already during the First World War, the establishment of the School of Slavonic Studies at King’s provided a home for East-Central European scholars and activists in exile from the Habsburg empire or countries under the occupation of the Central Powers.  While Slavic studies at King’s was originally strongly linked to the study of Russian language and literature, reflecting the wartime alliance with the Russian Empire, the collapse of that empire in 1917 deepened the association between Slavic studies and post-imperial self-determination in Eastern Europe. Already in the autumn of 1915, an inaugural lecture at King’s by Tomas G. Masaryk, who would later serve as the first president of Czechoslovakia, laid out a vision for ‘small nation’ emancipation that prefigured Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points.  This advocacy of national liberation did not, of course, extend to Britain’s own empire.  But emerging anti-colonial challenges, alongside the strains of the Great War, contributed to a growing sense that the core legitimacy and structures of British imperial rule could also be breaking apart. In many territories the response was one of brutal military reprisal, but there were also moves afoot to reimagine what empire stood for and what colonial rule could achieve. In place of the jingoistic militarism that characterized late-nineteenth expansion, greater emphasis was placed upon responsible administration and colonial development schemes. Like many British universities, King’s saw its role to train a new cadre of highly educated colonial officials to take up roles across empire. With a growing number of students arriving from colonial territories, the college became a space in which the ideology and politics of empire could be debated, challenged, and reimagined.

Before the Second World, only around 15% of 11-year-olds preceded to secondary school, with the rest leaving elementary school at 13/14 to enter the labour market. After 1944, it became mandatory for all 11 years olds to proceed to secondary school until 14 (raised to 15 in 1947 and 16 in 1972), with the promise of increased educational opportunity a cornerstone of the new welfare state. The new system was built around three types of school (secondary moderns, grammars, and technical), for which pupils were allocated based on ability through the mechanism of the 11-plus. Grammar schools were intended to serve an academic elite and provide access to university and prestigious careers for all who were cleverer enough, irrespective of social background. Access to university, however, did not expand as quickly with under 3% of school leavers carrying on into higher education until well into the 1960s. The Robbins Report (1963) recommended a massive expansion of provision, leading to both the founding of new universities and the slow expansion of intake among older institutions. This strand of research will examine how King’s changed in the era of mass education. Did it try to attract undergraduates from a more diverse range of backgrounds? How did the fellowship change?

Geopolitical pressures, economic dislocation, and fierce resistance across colonial territories combined to undermine the basis of Britain’s claim to imperial legitimacy. This transformation in global power sent reverberations through university culture that would have profound long-term implications. Students from across colonial and former colonial territories arrived in London in greater numbers than before to study at King’s. Many experienced racism and discrimination in London, and some become involved in emerging forms of community organization and resistance in Britain. King’s alumni include some notable activists against colonialism, racism and apartheid, such as Dr. Harold Moody, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and Helen Joseph. Following their studies at King’s, others made important contributions to the development of new Commonwealth states by taking up posts on their return home in key sectors and professions. They include a cohort of Canadian and Nigerian postgraduate history students, like Nigerian Kenneth Dike, who studied in London in the mid-twentieth century and who pioneered new national histories of their home countries, thereby making a significant contribution to wider decolonizing processes.
