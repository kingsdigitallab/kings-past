Instead of telling a single story, or creating a single list of heroes and villains, we’ve brought the history of King’s together in 13 moments. Each represents a theme, which was particularly significant at a particular moment in time. The moments provide focus for research into the details of King’s past. But they also provide a way for us to reflect on the relation between the past and future. Each moment poses a question for King’s and its community now, helping reflection on King’s past to shape our collective future.",g,u,k="King’s Past draws from the range of work and enthusiasm which already existed around the investigation of King’s past.
