Colleagues felt it was challenging to have a monument at the heart of King’s celebrating an army officer for exercising imperial violence in India, for having ‘reduced to order a turbulent people’ as the plaque put it. But instead of dealing with one moment, that conversation spawned a project to engage King’s past deep in time, and broad across space, and which would engage as much of the King’s community as possible.",n,l,C="Taking such an approach, we quickly recognised there could be no single seamless story about the history of King’s College London. Instead of telling a single story, or creating a single list of heroes and villains, we’ve brought the history of King’s together in 13 moments. Each represents a theme, which was particularly significant at a particular moment in time. The moments provide focus for research into the details of King’s past. But they also provide a way for us to reflect on the relation between the past and future. Each moment poses a question for King’s and its community now, helping reflection on King’s past to shape our collective future.",g,c,K="King’s Past draws from the range of work and enthusiasm which already existed around the investigation of King’s past.
