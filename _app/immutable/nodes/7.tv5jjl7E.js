But King’s has been at the centre of leading major scientific advances, has been at the forefront of inclusive education from women’s education in the 1880s to widening participation now, and has been a site of coordination of voices against empire and racism from across the world. Throughout its beginning King’s has been intertwined with structures which made the modern world, from empire to the nation state, science, medicine and engineering technology to modern political and bureaucratic. King’s history shares the complex of those modern institutions and structures.",H,b,E="King’s Past is based on the belief that our relationships and responsibilities now place a duty upon us to investigate and communicate the complexity of our past, in a way which allows us to go on to repair its implications in the present where we need to.",$,w,R="The project is a platform for that process of research and communication.
