But King’s has been at the centre of leading major scientific advances, has been at the forefront of inclusive education from women’s education in the 1880s to widening participation now, and has been a site of coordination of voices against empire and racism from across the world.

King’s history shares the complex of those modern institutions and structures.",L,b,S="The King’s Past project is based on the belief that our relationships and responsibilities now place a duty upon us to investigate and communicate the complexity of our past, which allow us to repair implications in the present where we need to.",$,w,z="The King’s Past project is a platform for that process of research and communication.
