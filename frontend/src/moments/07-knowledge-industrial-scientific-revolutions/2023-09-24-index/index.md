From the outset, King’s promised its students a modern education that, unlike the ancient universities, included study in the sciences. By the late-nineteenth century, the college had become one of the leading centres of scientific and medical research in the world. Research undertaken at King’s, including by preeminent figures such as James Clerk Maxwell and Joseph Lister, transformed scientific and medical knowledge.
