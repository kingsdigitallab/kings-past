From its foundation, King’s College sat at the heart of overlapping networks of institutional power in Britain. Founded in direct response to fears that higher education in London would be dominated by the Whiggish secularism taking root at UCL, King’s drew support from across Britain’s traditional social elites. The college’s 1,028 donors and share-holders included many from the highest echelons of the aristocracy, church, army and Royal Navy, City of London, and politics. Among these were some who had made fortunes through, and remained actively involved in, colonial trade and conquest in the Americas and South Asia. This included individuals who claimed ownership of enslaved people in the Caribbean, some who financed the West Indian slave and sugar economy from the board rooms of London’s banks and insurance companies, and others whose wealth had come through the East India Company’s expanding activities in Asia. This research will provide a comprehensive profile of who these individuals were, and crucially situate them within a wider set of social, political, and economic relationships inextricably connected to the core levers of power within the British state.
