King’s College, as it is today, comprises several institutions, each with a distinct history and brought together through a series of mergers from the late-nineteenth to late-twentieth centuries. Two of the most significant are Kings’ teaching hospitals, St Thomas’ and Guy’s, both of which existed for several hundred years before being incorporated into King’s.

Both benefitted hugely from wealth generated through the trans-Atlantic slave trade; St Thomas’ was rebuilt through donations by Robert Clayton – a City banker, MP, and investor in the Royal Africa Company – while Guy’s is named for its principal benefactor, Thomas Guy, whose wealth came from investments in the South Sea Company (both the RAC and SSC were major forces in the slave trade during the 17th and 18th centuries). This strand of research will situate these individuals and their bequests in the wider historical context of post-Civil War England where rapidly expanding global commercial opportunities transformed the City of London and a shifting moral economy energised new forms of civic philanthropy.1 It will provide an important contextual foundation for the subsequent Moments by surveying the area in which King’s would be built and mapping the geographies of power and wealth that marked London’s built environment before 1800.

## So what question…

King’s built environment: The legacies of St Thomas’ and Guy’s associations to the slave trade remain highly visible in the buildings and monuments of the two hospitals. Recent debates over what should happen to statues of Clayton and Guy typify the polarized, and polarizing, tone of public discourse around how to reconcile controversial histories with present day priorities, but also the need for rigorous and careful historical research. We might also include the King’s building itself and recently acquired Bush House in this conversation.
