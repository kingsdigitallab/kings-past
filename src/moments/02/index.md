King’s College has been positioned at the heart of networks of power and influence within the British world ever since its foundation in 1829. Inspired by concerns over the Whiggish secularism of the newly formed UCL, King’s drew on the financial resources of Britain’s establishment from its inception. The college’s 1,028 donors and shareholders included many from the highest echelons of the aristocracy, church, army and Royal Navy, City of London, and politics. Many had direct or indirect connections to colonial trade and conquest across the world, including those who claimed ownership of enslaved people in the Caribbean, some who financed the West Indian slave and sugar economy from the board rooms of London’s banks and insurance companies, and others whose wealth had come through the East India Company’s expanding activities in Asia. By exploring the backgrounds of who these individuals were and situating them in a wider set of social, political, and economic relationships this research will show how King’s was inextricably connected to the core levers of power within the British state.  

## So what question...

Donors & benefactors: At a point when universities across UK and North America are re-examining their historic connections to empire and slavery, questions around institutions’ relationships to donors and revenue sources in the present have become equally pressing. This Moment will help reveal the historical context in which King’s came into existence. Few expressed concerns in the 1820s over the origins of funds which went into founding, building, and equipping the college that students still move through today. It will provide crucial historical context to ongoing debates around how we might move forward as a community in way that acknowledges the complicated and discomforting history of an institution of higher education that has always existed as a central part of wider networks of power. Later donations from the Wills family (Imperial Tobacco), Alfred Mond (ICI), and more recently the Sacklers (Purdue Pharma) highlight the need to think carefully about the college’s relationship to donors and that this should not be confined to wealth derived from slavery alone.
