King’s close association to Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, – hero of the Napoleonic Wars and twice prime minister – has long been a source of fascination and celebration for the college. In the mid-nineteenth century, this also served an important practical function by providing a key connecting sinew to the British military establishment and facilitating links that have endured far beyond Wellington’s personal patronage. King’s first Military Studies Department was formed in 1848 and charged with preparing those who aspired to become officers in the British and East India Company armies. After 1858, military studies and science was merged into teaching under the Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Engineering, and while intended to be less vocational than the original Military Studies still contributed significant research that underpinned Britain’s expanding military and imperial strength in the period before 1914. After the First World War, Military Studies (subsequently war studies) was reinstated as a degree programme, running until 1948. It reappeared in the 1960s, before King’s now world-renowned War Studies degree was established in 1992.

Throughout this period, King’s fellows, research students, and archivists worked to expand the academic analysis of military science and the history, established the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives, and incorporated the study of war as a core specialism within the university. Relationships with the armed forces and other key agents of Britain’s expanding imperial power informed the college’s early development and institutional identity. More recently, this tradition has continued, less overtly but no less significantly, through collaborations with the Ministry of Defence, Security Services, and armed forces. This research strand will consider the intellectual and practical implications of these relationships. Much has been written on the idea of Britain’s nineteenth century liberal empire, but far less historiographical attention has been given to more conservative understandings of empire and imperial power, often premised on an assumption of military superiority. Understanding better how King’s contributed to these is crucial to gaining a more nuanced appreciation of the ways in which the college was invested in British imperialism, as well as how these early associations’ long afterlives have shaped the college’s development.
