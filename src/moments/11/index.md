In the decades after the Second World War, the British empire broke apart with a speed that few predicted. Geopolitical pressures, economic dislocation, and fierce resistance from colonial peoples combined to undermine the basis of Britain’s claim to imperial legitimacy. This transformation in global power was in part guided through scholarship and activism produced at King’s and sent reverberations through university culture that would have profound long-term implications. King’s scholars produced extensive research examining the shifting parameters of British colonial power within new Cold War constraints. Students from across colonial and former colonial territories arrived in London to study at King’s, with the scholarship making crucial contributions to anti-colonial (and anti-apartheid) thought and post-empire nation building. At the same time, their experience of racism and discrimination in London encouraged many to become involved in emerging forms of community organization and resistance in Britain. Exploring how student culture engaged with these wider questions will offer a sense of the ways in which decolonization mattered in King’s everyday life, while also illustrating the need to think about this process as having as much impact in Britain as it did across the wider empire.
