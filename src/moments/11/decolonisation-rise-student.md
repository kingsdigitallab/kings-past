King’s College London was traditionally viewed as more conservative, especially in its activism, compared to the more radical movements seen at UCL and LSE during the 1960s. This reputation, rooted in its historical ties to the Church of England and its focus on traditional disciplines such as medicine and law, set it apart from the more politically charged environments at UCL and LSE. LSE students were involved in radical protests, such as the ‘destruction of security gates’ during ‘sit-ins against U.S. involvement in Vietnam’ as reported by a _Daily Telegraph_ article on 25 January 1969, while UCL students participated in decolonisation efforts, including the International Student Conference in Ceylon, which brought together representatives from 40 non-Western nations to express solidarity with students in colonial territories.[^1] While King’s activism was comparatively smaller in scale and scope than the large-scale protests at UCL and LSE, it still reflected a growing awareness and concern for global issues among students, marking an important shift in the college’s student culture.

One notable example of early activism at King’s College London was the 1965 War on Want campaign, which demonstrated the growing student engagement with global humanitarian issues tied to decolonisation. Led by student Michael Packs, who served as chairman of the society during the 1965-66 academic year, the campaign raised £200 to support Algeria and Morocco—nations that had recently gained independence from French colonial rule. The funds were directed towards vital infrastructure projects, such as building wells and hospitals, highlighting a collective concern that extended beyond academic discussions. Packs captured this emerging ethos, stating, ‘King’s felt it should ease the suffering of those overseas'.[^2] Although this activism was more modest compared to the larger protests at UCL and LSE, it signaled a rising awareness among King’s students about the pressing issues of decolonisation and global justice. The same year the student branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (founded at King’s in 1958) urged students to ‘come to our meetings’, promoting a grassroots movement for peace and encouraging critical examination of the UK’s alignment with global powers.[^3]

Similarly, the Group Against Racial Discrimination (G.A.R.D.), featured in the 1965-66 student handbook, called for direct student action not only to oppose the South African government's apartheid policies but also to combat racial discrimination within the UK. By advocating that ‘students can act directly to alleviate the oppression of the National Union of South African Students’, the group heightened awareness and mobilised action against apartheid among the student body.[^4] Additionally, G.A.R.D. addressed domestic issues, urging students to confront racial discrimination in the UK, particularly in response to events like the Smethwick election and the introduction of the Race Relations Bill.[^5] These movements fostered a climate of critical engagement and activism at King’s, influencing how global and local human rights issues were discussed and addressed within the university community. This early foundation of activism paved the way for the establishment of the Anti-Apartheid Society in the 1970s, which continued and expanded upon the efforts initiated by the Group Against Racial Discrimination.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, several key societies emerged that continued to drive awareness and advocacy within the university. The Anti-Apartheid Society at King’s College London was actively campaigning in 1986, continuing the university’s strong tradition of student activism against apartheid. The society aimed to 'stimulate political awareness of students at King’s and promoted ongoing surveillance of firms involved in upholding apartheid. By publicizing these activities, the society sought to engage the wider university community, advocating for increased scrutiny and ethical consideration regarding such companies.[^6] The Third World Society, formed in 1978/79, was particularly active in highlighting severe economic exploitation in the Global South, a legacy of colonialism.[^7] The society focused on critical issues such as human rights, the arms trade, and economic disparities, discussing these topics in weekly meetings.[^8] These discussions undoubtedly contributed to a broader awareness of global responsibilities within the university community.

By 1983, student activism at King’s College London had become prominent enough to prompt a direct response from Nick Beeson, the newly elected President of the KCLSU for the 1983-84 academic year. In his introductory message, Beeson positioned himself as a non-political leader, seeking to create an inclusive and enjoyable student union. However, he also expressed concerns about increasing political divisions, notably stating, ‘there are minorities trying to turn this into a political jungle’.[^9] Beeson’s frustration was likely a reaction to the growing presence of student-led political groups within the KCLSU. During his presidency, there were eight distinct political societies, the student handbook even included a dedicated section titled ‘Political Societies’.[^10] This was a significant departure from earlier decades; for example, the 1950s handbooks did not have a specific section for political societies, reflecting a less politically engaged student culture.[^11] 

Among the political societies active during Beeson’s presidency were the Afro-Caribbean Society, which aimed to promote cultural awareness amid post-decolonisation migration, as well as the Anarchist Society, which advocated for ‘the struggle for real freedom’.[^12] These groups not only mirrored larger societal issues—such as efforts to combat racial discrimination in the wake of events like the 1981 Brixton uprising—but also contributed to the increasingly radical and diverse political discourse at King’s during the early 1980s. It is likely that Beeson’s comments about ‘political loonies’ were directed at these groups, which he felt were diverting the union from its primary purpose. Ironically, Beeson’s criticism provides clear evidence of the vibrant and sometimes contentious political atmosphere at King’s during this period. The activism he referenced involved left-wing groups and students advocating for causes like human rights, decolonisation, and social justice—issues that were gaining momentum across universities in the 1980s. One prominent example of this activism is the 1981/82 protests against increased student fees, which disproportionately affected students from formerly colonised countries. King’s students, alongside their peers from UCL, LSE, and Queen Mary, participated in widespread protests, marches, and demonstrations against the government’s decision to raise overseas student fees by 20-25%. This activism reflected broader concerns about economic justice and the protection of educational access for international students from the Global South.[^13]

Though King's College London was seen as more conservative compared to the radical activism at UCL and LSE, its student movements from the 1960s to the 1980s showed significant growth in engagement with global issues. While smaller in scale, activism at King's—through campaigns like War on Want and societies like G.A.R.D.—helped shift the university's culture. By the 1980s, the presence of multiple political societies and growing student advocacy on decolonisation and human rights demonstrated that activism at King's had become an integral part of student life, reflecting a broader shift toward global awareness.
