# { The Thirteen Moments }

King's Past began in 2022 with a conversation between the (then) Provost, the Dean and a historian, about a plaque in the chapel. Colleagues felt it was challenging to have a monument at the heart of King’s celebrating an army officer for exercising imperial violence in India, for having ‘reduced to order a turbulent people’ as the plaque put it. But instead of dealing with one moment, that conversation spawned a project to engage King's past deep in time, and broad across space, and which would engage as much of the King’s community as possible.

Taking such an approach, we quickly recognised there could be no single seamless story about the history of King's College London. Instead of telling a single story, or creating a single list of heroes and villains, we've brought the history of King's together in 13 moments. Each represents a theme, which was particularly significant at a particular moment in time. The moments provide focus for research into the details of King’s past. But they also provide a way for us to reflect on the relation between the past and future. Each moment poses a question for King’s and its community now, helping reflection on King’s past to shape our collective future. 

King's Past draws from the range of work and enthusiasm which already existed around the investigation of King’s past. It pulls in a range of existing work including
•	King’s Colonial Past module, taught in the history department
•	research into Sir Robert Clayton and Sir Thomas Guy, commissioned by Guys and St Thomas’ Trust
•	efforts led by KCLSU and academics to ‘liberate the curriculum’
•	Strandlines project, into the history of life around King’s site on the Strand
•	research by historians and others into the history of empire, and British public institutions
