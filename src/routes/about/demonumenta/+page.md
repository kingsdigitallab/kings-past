# The demonumenta project and King's Past 

Monuments are being challenged all over the world. In the city of São Paulo (Brazil), several monuments have been challenged in different ways by groups of people and social movements. The most radical cases are those linked to the 'bandeirantes'. Protests have denounced their role as slave traders, spreaders of disease and invaders of indigenous territories. 

In response to the social demand, the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/) developed a project called [demonumenta](http://demonumenta.fau.usp.br/sobre/). The project proposes a debate on the coloniality embedded in public institutions and collections, through a platform developed by [FAUUSP](https://www.fau.usp.br/) (Faculty of Architecture, Urbanism and Design of the University of São Paulo), students and professors, in collaboration with other institutions and research centres.[^1] 

The public clash with official sites of memory concerns not only monuments, but also architectural heritage and key pieces of historical collections. In its first phase in São Paulo, the project focused on monuments and uncomfortable architectural heritage related to the celebration of [Brazil's independence, the Modern Art Week of 1922 and its reverberations in 1932, 1954 and 1972](http://demonumenta.fau.usp.br/).

In the subsequent phase in London, we were able to bring these considerations and technologies to King's College London. With the expertise of visiting PhD student Luis Felipe Abbud from the Post-Graduate Course in Design at FAUUSP through a scholarship programme by CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel), we developed Extended Reality (XR) experiences with original 3D digital modelling of three statues related to the history of King's College London. 

As an extension of the project idealised by [Prof. Giselle Beiguelman](http://www.iea.usp.br/en/persons/speakers/copy_of_giselle-beiguelman) of FAUUSP, and originally conceived to problematise a series of public monuments in the city of Sao Paulo through a decolonial lens, augmented and mixed reality experiences were developed through the recreation of statues that reflect the historical connections of King's College London.

Our team created audio guides for three statues, including one honouring an important former student, James Africanus Horton, who deserves greater recognition in the King's Past project.

We were able to produce a demonumenta version for King's College London through the collaborative work of a team. Students Gian Ghatora, Sadie Mansfield, Abiufo Dan-Abia and Mustafa Harabou were supervised by project coordinator Dr Erika Melek Delgado to develop historical research, articles and scripts for each statue. Voiceovers were recorded to accompany the virtual experience of exploring each statue's history. Their work provides compelling stories and insights that bring the statues to life in a whole new way.

The King's Past team would especially like to thank Luis Felipe Abbud, Prof. Giselle Beiguelman, the demonumenta project, the University of Sao Paulo and CAPES for sharing their reflections, technology and enthusiasm in this first step of King's College London to engage with its own past.
