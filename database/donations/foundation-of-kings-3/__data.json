In 1814, he was ordained as deacon and as a priest in 1817. He gained George IV favour at a dinner party which had a significant impact on his future preferments. The King appointed him to the canonry of Windsor this was, however, refused by Lord Liverpool and the canonry was given to Dr James Stanier Clarke while Sumner was given all his prior appointments. Sumner was made the private chaplain to the King, historiographer to the crown, chaplain to the household at Carlton House and librarian to the King. From 1821 to 1822, he was vicar of St Helens in Abingdon, and from 1822 to 1825, Sumner was appointed to the second canonry of Worcester Cathedral and Canterbury until 1827. In 1826, he was consecrated as bishop of Llandaff, which he held alongside the deanery of St Pauls. The King then helped appoint him to the bishopric of Winchester where he unusually practised regular visitation. By 1867, two hundred and one permanent and temporary churches were built in his diocese as well as three hundred and twelve churchyards and cemeteries.
