He left office in March 1801, but served as prime minister again from 1804 until his death in 1806. He was also Chancellor of the Exchequer for all of his time as prime minister. He is known as "Pitt the Younger" to distinguish him from his father, William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, who had previously served as prime minister and is referred to as "William Pitt the Elder" (or "Chatham" by historians). Pitt, although often referred to as a Tory, or "new Tory", called himself an "independent Whig" and was generally opposed to the development of a strict partisan political system.Pitt was regarded as an outstanding administrator who worked for efficiency and reform, bringing in a new generation of competent administrators. He increased taxes to pay for the great war against France and cracked down on radicalism. To engage the threat of Irish support for France, he engineered the Acts of Union 1800 and tried (but failed) to secure Catholic emancipation as part of the Union. He created the "new Toryism", which revived the Tory Party and enabled it to stay in power for the next quarter-century.</p></article></article></div></main> <footer class="svelte-1xwbp8x"><picture class="svelte-1xwbp8x" data-svelte-h="svelte-s75sf0"><img src="/kings-past/_app/immutable/assets/footer.eAdl43Wd.jpg" alt="King's College London stamp from..."></picture> <div class="layout surface-2 svelte-1xwbp8x"><section class="links svelte-1xwbp8x"><a href="../.." class="title svelte-1xwbp8x"><strong class="svelte-1xwbp8x">King's Past</strong></a> <ul class="project svelte-1xwbp8x"><li class="svelte-1xwbp8x"><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/history" class="svelte-1xwbp8x">Department of History</a> </li><li class="svelte-1xwbp8x"><a href="../../accessibility-statement" class="svelte-1xwbp8x">Accessibility statement</a> </li><li class="svelte-1xwbp8x"><a href="../../privacy-policy" class="svelte-1xwbp8x">Privacy policy</a> </li></ul> <ul class="social svelte-1xwbp8x"><li class="svelte-1xwbp8x"><a href="https://instagram.com/kingspastkcl" aria-label="Link to the King's Past instagram account" class="svelte-1xwbp8x"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide-icon lucide lucide-instagram "><rect width="20" height="20" x="2" y="2" rx="5" ry="5"></rect><path d="M16 11.37A4 4 0 1 1 12.63 8 4 4 0 0 1 16 11.37z"></path><line x1="17.5" x2="17.51" y1="6.5" y2="6.5"></line></svg></a> </li><li class="svelte-1xwbp8x"><a href="https://twitter.com/kingshistory" aria-label="Link to the King's College History department twitter account" class="svelte-1xwbp8x"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide-icon lucide lucide-twitter "><path d="M22 4s-.7 2.1-2 3.4c1.6 10-9.4 17.3-18 11.6 2.2.1 4.4-.6 6-2C3 15.5.5 9.6 3 5c2.2 2.6 5.6 4.1 9 4-.9-4.2 4-6.6 7-3.8 1.1 0 3-1.2 3-1.2z"></path></svg></a> </li></ul></section></div> <div class="layout surface-3 svelte-1xwbp8x" data-svelte-h="svelte-106ofi2"><section class="kdl svelte-1xwbp8x"><p class="svelte-1xwbp8x">Designed, developed and maintained by <a href="https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk" class="svelte-1xwbp8x">King&#39;s Digital Lab</a></p></section></div> </footer> </div>
