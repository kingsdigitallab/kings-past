Born in London, Goulburn was the eldest son of a wealthy planter, Munbee Goulburn, of Amity Hall, Vere Parish, Jamaica, and his wife Susannah, eldest daughter of William Chetwynd, 4th Viscount Chetwynd. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge.Goulburn's inheritance included a number of sugar estates in Jamaica, with Amity Hall in the parish of Vere, now Clarendon Parish, being the most important. Slave labour was still being used to work the sugar plantations when he inherited the estates. Goulburn never visited Jamaica himself due to his health and political work. He relied on attorneys to manage his estates on his behalf. One attorney, in particular, Thomas Samson, held the top job at the estate from 1802 to 1818 and earned a reputation for cruelty towards Goulburn's slaves.By 1818, the income from his Jamaican estates halved to less than Â£3,000 \"although he did console himself that the condition of his slaves had probably improved\".Goulburn was a member of the Canterbury Association from 27 March 1848.","2024-02-29T11:55:18.886933+00:00","Assigned male at birth","English","United Kingdom","White",true,"Gillian Lamb"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
