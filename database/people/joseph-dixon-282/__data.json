In 1827, Parry attempted one of the earliest expeditions to the North Pole. He reached 82° 45' N, setting a record for human exploration Farthest North that stood for nearly five decades before being surpassed at 83° 20' N by Albert Hastings Markham in 1875. Parry was born in Bath, Somerset, the son of Caleb Hillier Parry and Sarah Rigby. He was educated at King Edward's School.At the age of thirteen he joined the flagship of Admiral Sir William Cornwallis in the Channel fleet as a first-class volunteer, in 1806 became a midshipman, and in 1810 received promotion to the rank of lieutenant in the frigate Alexander, which spent the next three years in the protection of the Spitsbergen whale fishery. Parry took advantage of this opportunity for the study and practice of astronomical observations in northern latitudes, and afterwards published the results of his studies in a small volume on Nautical Astronomy by Night. From 1813 to 1817 he served on the North American Station.Parry's character was influenced by his religiousness, and besides the journals of his different voyages he also wrote a Lecture to Seamen, and Thoughts on the Parental Character of God. He was noted as \"an evangelical [Christian] and an ardent advocate of moral reform in the navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","2024-02-29T12:25:30.461339+00:00","English","United Kingdom","White","Gillian Lamb",{"id":26,"name":27,"slug":28,"alternative_names":6,"description":29,"created_at":30,"gender":31,"language":21,"nationality":22,"ethnicity":23,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":24},141,"Agnes Cotton","agnes-cotton-141","(27 February 1828 – 20 May 1899) was an English social reformer and philanthropist. She founded and ran a home in Leytonstone for 'fallen girls' called The Pastures.Cotton was considered to be a philanthropist by the time she was 18. She helped her sister Sarah Acland in her philanthropy projects and started to create her own projects to care for children in Leytonstone. Her siblings included the judge Henry Cotton, the philanthropist Sarah Acland, and the missionary William Cotton. In 1865, Cotton opened a children's home with an attached laundry for girls. This was expanded when she moved to The Cedars, a home once operated as an orphanage/school by the Methodist preacher Mary Bosanquet. She renamed the house 'The Pastures. In about 1880, Cotton paid for an expansion of the existing building. The site in Leytonstone now included a chapel, industrial laundry, school and was known as the 'Home of the Good Shepherd' to differentiate it from 'The Pastures,' which was the former base. Previously Cotton's good works had been funded by herself, her family, and well wishers; in the 1880s the home attracted funding from the state. It was registered under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, although it was not a home for delinquent girls but a place of training in laundry work for girls who had been involved in prostitution. Rumours about harsh treatment inside of The Pastures began to spread in 1894. Rumours varied from stories about the girls being unsupervised, to abused, to stories about Cotton being too old for the job. The Home Office was called into investigate after Reverend A. Drew, a chairman of the London School Board, demanded an inquiry. Inspector William Inglis concluded that the rumours were false, and exonerated Cotton. Despite her exoneration, the London School Board cut ties with Cotton in 1895.","2024-02-29T12:14:48.744236+00:00","Assigned male at birth",{"id":33,"name":34,"slug":35,"alternative_names":6,"description":36,"created_at":37,"gender":31,"language":21,"nationality":22,"ethnicity":23,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":24},126,"Andrew Burnaby","andrew-burnaby-126","Archdeacon of Leicester.

This important and influential text, which skilfully analysed case histories, and aimed to teach surgeons how to preserve limbs that might otherwise have been amputated, went through five editions, and was translated into several languages. It included descriptions of hysterical pseudo-fracture of the spine, and the first clinical description of ankylosing spondylitis. In the fifth edition (1850) he identified Brodie's disease, a chronic synovitis in which an affected joint undergoes a pulpy degeneration. In 1828 he devised a technique for trephining the tibia for chronic inflammation (Brodie's abscess); in 1835 he pioneered a technique for correction of abnormalities in the anal sphincter (Brodie's pile); and in 1840 he identified a particular form of breast tumour (Brodie's tumour).He firmly believed that its moral, religious, and scientific education and leadership should distinguish the élite of the medical profession. He therefore strongly supported the foundation of the London Medical Gazette in 1827 to counter Thomas Wakley's assertions in The Lancet that hospital surgeons and the council of the Royal College of Surgeons were corrupt. He was president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society (1839), where he introduced discussions at meetings. In 1844 he was elected president of the Royal College of Surgeons, having been for many years examiner and member of the council, and having introduced important improvements into the system of examinations and the structure of its hitherto self-perpetuating council.

It lasted for only six issues, but it made Knight's name as publisher and author, beginning a career which lasted over forty years.[1] The periodical included an 1824 review of Frankenstein in which Percy Bysshe Shelley was attributed as the author in a comparison with his wife's second novel Valperga.

He is among the commanders who won and ended the Napoleonic Wars when the Seventh Coalition defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Bborn in the Kingdom of Ireland into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family, belonging to the Protestant Ascendancy, beginning life as The Hon. Arthur Wesley. Wellesley was born the son of Anne, Countess of Mornington, and Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington. His father was himself the son of Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington, and had a short career in politics representing the constituency of Trim in the Irish House of Commons before succeeding his father as Baron Mornington in 1758. Garret Mornington was also an accomplished composer, and in recognition of his musical and philanthropic achievements was elevated to the rank of Earl of Mornington in 1760.Wellesley's mother was the eldest daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon, after whom Wellesley was named. His term as prime minister was marked by Roman Catholic Emancipation: the restoration of most civil rights to Roman Catholics in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The change was prompted by the landslide by-election win of Daniel O'Connell, a Roman Catholic Irish proponent of emancipation, who was elected despite not being legally allowed to sit in Parliament. In the House of Lords, facing stiff opposition, Wellington spoke for Catholic Emancipation, and according to some sources, gave one of the best speeches of his career. Wellington was born in Ireland and so had some understanding of the grievances of the Roman Catholic majority there; as Chief Secretary, he had given an undertaking that the remaining Penal Laws would only be enforced as \"mildly\" as possible. In 1811 Catholic soldiers were given freedom of worship and 18 years later the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 was passed with a majority of 105. Many Tories voted against the Act, and it passed only with the help of the Whigs. Wellington had threatened to resign as prime minister if King George IV did not give Royal Assent. The nickname \"Iron Duke\" originated from this period, when he experienced a high degree of personal and political unpopularity. During this time, Wellington was greeted by a hostile reaction from the crowds at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Wellington was gradually superseded as leader of the Tories by Robert Peel, while the party evolved into the Conservatives. When the Tories were returned to power in 1834, Wellington declined to become prime minister because he thought membership in the House of Commons had become essential. The king reluctantly approved Peel, who was in Italy.In 1824, one liaison came back to haunt him, when Wellington received a letter from a publisher, John Joseph Stockdale, offering to refrain from issuing an edition of the rather racy memoirs of one of his mistresses, Harriette Wilson, in exchange for money. It is said that the Duke promptly returned the letter, after scrawling across it, \"Publish and be damned\". However, Hibbert notes in his biography that the letter can be found among the Duke's papers, with nothing written on it. It is certain that Wellington did reply, and the tone of a further letter from the publisher, quoted by Longford, suggests that he had refused in the strongest language to submit to blackmail.","2024-02-29T11:40:24.882143+00:00","Wellesley was born into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family.",{"id":320,"name":321,"slug":322,"alternative_names":6,"description":6,"created_at":323,"gender":6,"language":6,"nationality":6,"ethnicity":6,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":9},340,"Duke of York","duke-of-york-340","2024-09-22T16:33:09.860974+00:00",{"id":325,"name":326,"slug":327,"alternative_names":328,"description":329,"created_at":330,"gender":31,"language":21,"nationality":22,"ethnicity":23,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":9},287,"Earl Brownlow","earl-brownlow-287","John Cust","The eldest son of the 1st Baron of Brownlow, elected MP for Clitheroe in 1802 after his tour of Russia and Germany in 1801.

The exception was Edwy and Elgiva, which was not well received by the public and closed after the first night's performance despite having Sarah Siddons in the cast.From her fifteenth year Frances lived in the midst of a brilliant social circle, gathered round her father in Poland Street, and later in St Martin's Street. Garrick was a constant visitor, and would arrive before eight o'clock in the morning. Of the various \"lyons\" they entertained she leaves a graphic account, notably of Omai, the young man from Raiatea, and of Alexis Orlov, a favourite of Catherine the Great. She first met Dr Johnson at her father's home in March 1777.Married General Alexandre d'Arblay, French emigre and supported the family through her writings.

The death of his wife in 1831, brother in 1839 and daughter in 1840 caused him deep distress, driving him to sell his Westminster house in 1840 and move in with his sister-in-law in Clapton.","2024-09-12T11:24:16.755365+00:00",{"id":833,"name":827,"slug":834,"alternative_names":6,"description":835,"created_at":836,"gender":31,"language":21,"nationality":22,"ethnicity":23,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":24},133,"joshua-watson-133","English wine merchant, philanthropist, a prominent member of the high church party and of several charitable organisations, who became known as \"the best layman in England\". Married Mary whose uncle was Charles Daubeney. Joshua from his early years was brought into contact with other members of the high-church party, of which he afterwards became the virtual leader. Among his early friends and advisers were William Stevens, the disciple and biographer of William Jones of Nayland, and founder of the Club of Nobody's Friends, of which Joshua Watson was an original member; Jonathan Boucher, who became in 1785 vicar of Epsom, where John James Watson had his first curacy; and Sir John Richardson (afterwards a judge in the court of common pleas), who had been a college friend of John James Watson.Among other friends were Henry Handley Norris, with whom he maintained an unbroken friendship of nearly sixty years, and William Van Mildert, rector of St. Mary-le-Bow in the city (afterwards bishop of Durham). Van Mildert submitted both his Boyle Lectures and his Bampton Lectures to Watson's revision, and was largely guided by his advice in literary matters. Nor was Van Mildert the only man of letters who showed confidence in his literary power. At the house of Van Mildert in Ely Place he met the elder Christopher Wordsworth, master of Trinity College, Cambridge, whom he joined in revising the proof-sheets of Christopher Wordsworth the younger's work, Theophilus Anglicanus. These men were, with Archdeacon Benjamin Harrison and William Rowe Lyall, Watson's chief friends and coadjutors. In 1814 Watson retired from business to devote himself exclusively to works of piety and charity. He never missed any meeting of the Society for Propagation of the Gospel, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, or the National Society, and his counsel was highly valued. He took a deep interest in the colonial church, being an intimate friend of Bishop Middleton of Calcutta, Bishop Inglis of Nova Scotia, Bishop Broughton of Australasia, and subsequently Bishop Selwyn of New Zealand. In 1814 he was appointed, together with his friend Archdeacon Cambridge, treasurer of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, which during his treasurership increased greatly its work and income. About the same time he became secretary of the relief fund for the German sufferers from the Napoleonic wars. In 1817 the Church Building Society, called at first the Church Room Society, was formed. Watson was largely instrumental in its foundation, drawing up the original resolution. This was quickly followed by a royal commission for church building issued under Lord Liverpool's government. Watson was one of the commissioners, and found the work so engrossing that in 1822 he took a house, No. 6 Park Street, Westminster, where he lived for sixteen years, to be near the scene of his labours.He was also treasurer of the Clergy Orphan School, which was, perhaps, of all his benevolent schemes, the one nearest to his heart.","2024-02-29T11:30:20.999889+00:00",{"id":838,"name":839,"slug":840,"alternative_names":6,"description":6,"created_at":841,"gender":6,"language":6,"nationality":6,"ethnicity":6,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":9},242,"J.P.

He was a keen supporter both politically and financially of Charles James Fox going into opposition with him in 1783.

In 1828 he took a leading role in the repeal of the Test Acts which discriminated against Catholics and Protestant dissenters. He was one of the principal architects of the Reform Act 1832, which was the first major reform of Parliament since the Restoration, and a significant early step on the road to democracy and away from rule by the aristocracy and landed gentry. He favoured expanding the right to vote to the middle classes and enfranchising Britain's growing industrial towns and cities, but he never advocated universal suffrage and he opposed the secret ballot. Russell was outspoken on many issues over the course of his career, advocating Catholic emancipation in the 1820s, calling for the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1845, denouncing Pope Pius IX's revival of Catholic bishoprics in 1850, and supporting Italian unification during the 1860s. Russell's political agenda was frequently frustrated by his lack of a reliable Commons majority. However, his government was able to secure a number of notable social reforms. Russell introduced teachers' pensions and used Orders in Council to make grants for teacher training. The Public Baths and Wash-houses Acts of 1847 and 1848 enabled local authorities to build municipal baths and washing facilities for the growing urban working classes. Russell lent his support to the passage of the Factories Act 1847, which restricted the working hours of women and young persons (aged 13–18) in textile mills to 10 hours per day.Russell married Adelaide Lister (widow of Thomas Lister, 2nd Baron Ribblesdale, who had died in 1832) on 11 April 1835.

In 1780, Sheridan entered the House of Commons as the ally of Charles James Fox on the side of the American Colonials in the political debate of that year. He is said to have paid the burgesses of Stafford five guineas apiece to allow him to represent them. As a consequence, his first speech in Parliament was a defence against the charge of bribery.He held the posts of Receiver-General of the Duchy of Cornwall (1804–1807) and Treasurer of the Navy (1806–1807). Sheridan was noted for his close political relationship with the Prince of Wales, leading a faction of his supporters in the Commons. By 1805 when the Prince was cooling on his previous support of Catholic Emancipation Sheridan, George Tierney and others announced their own opposition to it.[22]\n\nWhen, after 32 years in Parliament, he lost re-election in 1812, his creditors closed in on him and his last years were harassed by debt and disappointment.

He is regarded as the father of modern British policing, owing to his founding of the Metropolitan Police Service. Peel was one of the founders of the modern Conservative Party.The son of a wealthy textile manufacturer and politician, Peel was the first prime minister from an industrial business background. He earned a double first in classics and mathematics from Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the House of Commons in 1809 and became a rising star in the Tory Party. Peel entered the Cabinet as home secretary (1822–1827), where he reformed and liberalised the criminal law and created the modern police force, leading to a new type of officer known in tribute to him as \"bobbies\" and \"peelers\". After a brief period out of office he returned as home secretary under his political mentor the Duke of Wellington (1828–1830), also serving as Leader of the House of Commons. Initially, a supporter of continued legal discrimination against Catholics, Peel reversed himself and supported the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 and the 1828 repeal of the Test Act, claiming that \"though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger\".Peel often started from a traditional Tory position in opposition to a measure, then reversed his stance and became the leader in supporting liberal legislation. This happened with the Test Act, Catholic emancipation, the Reform Act, income tax and, most notably, the repeal of the Corn Laws. Historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote: \"Peel was in the first rank of 19th-century statesmen. He carried Catholic Emancipation; he repealed the Corn Laws; he created the modern Conservative Party on the ruins of the old Toryism. Peel was born at Chamber Hall, Bury, Lancashire, to the industrialist and parliamentarian Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, and his wife Ellen Yates. His father was one of the richest textile manufacturers of the early Industrial Revolution. Peel received his early education from a clergyman tutor in Bury and at a clergyman's local school in Tamworth.He may also have attended Bury Grammar School or Hipperholme Grammar School, though evidence for either is anecdotal rather than textual. He started at Harrow School in February 1800. At Harrow, he was a contemporary of Lord Byron. Attended Christ Church, Oxford, which Peel attended 1805–1808, graduating with a double first. In 1805, Peel matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. His tutor was Charles Lloyd, later Regius Professor of Divinity, on Peel's recommendation appointed bishop of Oxford. In 1808 Peel became the first Oxford student to take a double first in Classics and Mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","2024-02-29T11:50:24.825531+00:00",{"id":1271,"name":1272,"slug":1273,"alternative_names":6,"description":1274,"created_at":1275,"gender":31,"language":21,"nationality":22,"ethnicity":23,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":24},132,"Sir William Weller Pepys","sir-william-weller-pepys-132","2nd Baron Pepys, was a lawyer who became Master in Chancery.

Cotton was a merchant, inventor, banker, and philanthropist, who during his lifetime built numerous churches and schools for the working classes. Cotton came from a well-established upper middle-class family. His father (Joseph Cotton, 1745-1825) had made his money as a captain for the East India Company (EIC) taking advantage of expanding imperial trade and was later appointed a director of the EIC. His grandfather (Dr Nathaniel Cotton, 1705-1788) was a highly respected physician.  Cotton was a deeply religious man and during his lifetime was involved with societies such as the Colonial Bishoprics Fund, Hackney Phalanx of Prominent Churchmen and Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. Cotton believed that moral reform was the best form of patriotism. Importantly, he argued that the poor needed to be relieved of their poverty before their morals could be judged. His philanthropy therefore focused on the promotion of institutions that could relieve economic and social pressures. This included his zeal for building churches, promoting public baths, wash houses and model lodging houses.  \n\nHowever, Cotton’s behaviour was not always so exemplary. During his time at Chigwell Grammar, 15-year-old Cotton was accused of setting fire to the headmaster’s garden. Cotton married Sarah Fowler in 1812. The couple had seven children together and Cotton maintained a keen interest in their upbringing and education. Reflecting both his business shrewdness and his familial shipping legacy, Cotton first began his career at the Limehouse shipping firm Huddart & Co. which he later adopted full control of, he also invented steam driven rope making machinery and in 1851 was awarded the Telford Medal from the Institution of Civil Engineers. During his tenure at the Bank of England, Cotton alongside Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel and Conservative plantation owner, Henry Goulburn, produced the Bank Charter Act of 1844. One of his most valued inventions was an automatic weighing machine for sovereigns, colloquially referred to as ‘the governor’, which won a medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and was used extensively at the Bank of England. William Cotton became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1821, was elected chairman of the London Hospital in 1827 and became treasurer in 1837 echoing some of the roles he undertook for the newly founded King’s College London in 1829. He also used the many connections he made through these roles to fundraise for King’s College London. However, the man he had the most contact with at King’s was his friend Henry Nelson Coleridge, who was also an important council member. Cotton was described by historian Hearnshaw as a ‘venerable member’ of King’s and one whose death in 1866 marked ‘the first age of the college’ coming to an end.","2024-03-21T11:22:08.076963+00:00",{"id":1397,"name":1398,"slug":1399,"alternative_names":6,"description":6,"created_at":1400,"gender":6,"language":6,"nationality":6,"ethnicity":6,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":9},291,"William Gifford","william-gifford-291","2024-09-11T15:10:38.603134+00:00",{"id":1402,"name":1403,"slug":1404,"alternative_names":6,"description":6,"created_at":475,"gender":31,"language":21,"nationality":22,"ethnicity":6,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":78},270,"William Hay Chapman","william-hay-chapman-270",{"id":1406,"name":1407,"slug":1408,"alternative_names":6,"description":6,"created_at":1409,"gender":6,"language":6,"nationality":6,"ethnicity":6,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":9},316,"William Henry Cholmondeley","william-henry-cholmondeley-316","2024-09-21T16:45:54.418202+00:00",{"id":1411,"name":1412,"slug":1413,"alternative_names":6,"description":6,"created_at":1414,"gender":6,"language":6,"nationality":6,"ethnicity":6,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":9},350,"William Hill","william-hill-350","2024-09-23T15:44:14.570847+00:00",{"id":1416,"name":1417,"slug":1418,"alternative_names":1419,"description":1420,"created_at":1421,"gender":31,"language":21,"nationality":22,"ethnicity":23,"ethnicity_description":6,"nationality_description":6,"draft":8,"added_by":9},342,"William Howley","william-howley-342","Right Hon.

Pitt, although often referred to as a Tory, or \"new Tory\", called himself an \"independent Whig\" and was generally opposed to the development of a strict partisan political system.Pitt was regarded as an outstanding administrator who worked for efficiency and reform, bringing in a new generation of competent administrators. He increased taxes to pay for the great war against France and cracked down on radicalism. To engage the threat of Irish support for France, he engineered the Acts of Union 1800 and tried (but failed) to secure Catholic emancipation as part of the Union.

A native of Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, and became an independent Member of Parliament (MP) for Yorkshire (1784–1812). In 1785, he underwent a conversion experience and became an Evangelical Anglican, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform.In 1787, Wilberforce came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of activists against the slave trade, including Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he became a leading English abolitionist. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for 20 years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807.Wilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice, British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, the foundation of the Church Mission Society and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially repressive legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad.In later years, Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire. Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt the Younger. Attended Hull Grammar School, which at the time was headed by a young, dynamic headmaster, Joseph Milner, who was to become a lifelong friend. In October 1776, at the age of seventeen, Wilberforce went up to St John's College, Cambridge.In October 1784, Wilberforce embarked upon a tour of Europe which would ultimately change his life and determine his future career. He travelled with his mother and sister in the company of Isaac Milner, the brilliant younger brother of his former headmaster, who had been Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, in the year when Wilberforce first went up.

Northwest Passage, until it was finally negotiated by Roald Amundsen in 1906. In 1827, Parry attempted one of the earliest expeditions to the North Pole. He reached 82° 45' N, setting a record for human exploration Farthest North that stood for nearly five decades before being surpassed at 83° 20' N by Albert Hastings Markham in 1875. Parry was born in Bath, Somerset, the son of Caleb Hillier Parry and Sarah Rigby. He was educated at King Edward's School.At the age of thirteen he joined the flagship of Admiral Sir William Cornwallis in the Channel fleet as a first-class volunteer, in 1806 became a midshipman, and in 1810 received promotion to the rank of lieutenant in the frigate Alexander, which spent the next three years in the protection of the Spitsbergen whale fishery. Parry took advantage of this opportunity for the study and practice of astronomical observations in northern latitudes, and afterwards published the results of his studies in a small volume on Nautical Astronomy by Night. From 1813 to 1817 he served on the North American Station.Parry's character was influenced by his religiousness, and besides the journals of his different voyages he also wrote a Lecture to Seamen, and Thoughts on the Parental Character of God. He was noted as \"an evangelical [Christian] and an ardent advocate of moral reform in the navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","2024-02-29T12:25:30.461339+00:00","English","United Kingdom","White","Gillian Lamb",{"id":43,"name":44,"slug":45,"alternative_names":5,"description":46,"created_at":47,"gender":48,"language":38,"nationality":39,"ethnicity":40,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":41},141,"Agnes Cotton","agnes-cotton-141","(27 February 1828 – 20 May 1899) was an English social reformer and philanthropist. She founded and ran a home in Leytonstone for 'fallen girls' called The Pastures.Cotton was considered to be a philanthropist by the time she was 18. She helped her sister Sarah Acland in her philanthropy projects and started to create her own projects to care for children in Leytonstone. Her siblings included the judge Henry Cotton, the philanthropist Sarah Acland, and the missionary William Cotton. In 1865, Cotton opened a children's home with an attached laundry for girls. This was expanded when she moved to The Cedars, a home once operated as an orphanage/school by the Methodist preacher Mary Bosanquet. She renamed the house 'The Pastures. In about 1880, Cotton paid for an expansion of the existing building. The site in Leytonstone now included a chapel, industrial laundry, school and was known as the 'Home of the Good Shepherd' to differentiate it from 'The Pastures,' which was the former base. Previously Cotton's good works had been funded by herself, her family, and well wishers; in the 1880s the home attracted funding from the state. It was registered under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, although it was not a home for delinquent girls but a place of training in laundry work for girls who had been involved in prostitution. Rumours about harsh treatment inside of The Pastures began to spread in 1894. Rumours varied from stories about the girls being unsupervised, to abused, to stories about Cotton being too old for the job. The Home Office was called into investigate after Reverend A. Drew, a chairman of the London School Board, demanded an inquiry. Inspector William Inglis concluded that the rumours were false, and exonerated Cotton. Despite her exoneration, the London School Board cut ties with Cotton in 1895.","2024-02-29T12:14:48.744236+00:00","Assigned male at birth",{"id":50,"name":51,"slug":52,"alternative_names":5,"description":53,"created_at":54,"gender":48,"language":38,"nationality":39,"ethnicity":40,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":41},126,"Andrew Burnaby","andrew-burnaby-126","Archdeacon of Leicester.

In the fifth edition (1850) he identified Brodie's disease, a chronic synovitis in which an affected joint undergoes a pulpy degeneration. In 1828 he devised a technique for trephining the tibia for chronic inflammation (Brodie's abscess); in 1835 he pioneered a technique for correction of abnormalities in the anal sphincter (Brodie's pile); and in 1840 he identified a particular form of breast tumour (Brodie's tumour).He firmly believed that its moral, religious, and scientific education and leadership should distinguish the élite of the medical profession. He therefore strongly supported the foundation of the London Medical Gazette in 1827 to counter Thomas Wakley's assertions in The Lancet that hospital surgeons and the council of the Royal College of Surgeons were corrupt. He was president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society (1839), where he introduced discussions at meetings. In 1844 he was elected president of the Royal College of Surgeons, having been for many years examiner and member of the council, and having introduced important improvements into the system of examinations and the structure of its hitherto self-perpetuating council. Together with Joseph Henry Green and John Simon he was closely involved in the complex negotiations that led to the Medical Act of 1858.","2024-03-29T22:47:23.932771+00:00",{"id":132,"name":133,"slug":134,"alternative_names":135,"description":5,"created_at":136,"gender":5,"language":5,"nationality":5,"ethnicity":5,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":8},295,"Benjamin Disraeli","benjamin-disraeli-295","First Earl of Beaconsfield","2024-09-11T15:48:38.003656+00:00",{"id":138,"name":139,"slug":140,"alternative_names":5,"description":5,"created_at":141,"gender":5,"language":5,"nationality":5,"ethnicity":5,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":8},347,"Benjamin Harrison","benjamin-harrison-347","2024-09-23T10:53:24.221822+00:00",{"id":143,"name":144,"slug":145,"alternative_names":146,"description":147,"created_at":148,"gender":48,"language":38,"nationality":39,"ethnicity":40,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":8},187,"Bowyer Edward Sparke","bowyer-edward-sparke-187","Rt.

He is among the commanders who won and ended the Napoleonic Wars when the Seventh Coalition defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Bborn in the Kingdom of Ireland into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family, belonging to the Protestant Ascendancy, beginning life as The Hon. Arthur Wesley. Wellesley was born the son of Anne, Countess of Mornington, and Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington. His father was himself the son of Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington, and had a short career in politics representing the constituency of Trim in the Irish House of Commons before succeeding his father as Baron Mornington in 1758. Garret Mornington was also an accomplished composer, and in recognition of his musical and philanthropic achievements was elevated to the rank of Earl of Mornington in 1760.Wellesley's mother was the eldest daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon, after whom Wellesley was named. His term as prime minister was marked by Roman Catholic Emancipation: the restoration of most civil rights to Roman Catholics in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The change was prompted by the landslide by-election win of Daniel O'Connell, a Roman Catholic Irish proponent of emancipation, who was elected despite not being legally allowed to sit in Parliament. In the House of Lords, facing stiff opposition, Wellington spoke for Catholic Emancipation, and according to some sources, gave one of the best speeches of his career. Wellington was born in Ireland and so had some understanding of the grievances of the Roman Catholic majority there; as Chief Secretary, he had given an undertaking that the remaining Penal Laws would only be enforced as \"mildly\" as possible. In 1811 Catholic soldiers were given freedom of worship and 18 years later the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 was passed with a majority of 105. Many Tories voted against the Act, and it passed only with the help of the Whigs. Wellington had threatened to resign as prime minister if King George IV did not give Royal Assent. The nickname \"Iron Duke\" originated from this period, when he experienced a high degree of personal and political unpopularity. During this time, Wellington was greeted by a hostile reaction from the crowds at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Wellington was gradually superseded as leader of the Tories by Robert Peel, while the party evolved into the Conservatives. When the Tories were returned to power in 1834, Wellington declined to become prime minister because he thought membership in the House of Commons had become essential. The king reluctantly approved Peel, who was in Italy.In 1824, one liaison came back to haunt him, when Wellington received a letter from a publisher, John Joseph Stockdale, offering to refrain from issuing an edition of the rather racy memoirs of one of his mistresses, Harriette Wilson, in exchange for money. It is said that the Duke promptly returned the letter, after scrawling across it, \"Publish and be damned\". However, Hibbert notes in his biography that the letter can be found among the Duke's papers, with nothing written on it. It is certain that Wellington did reply, and the tone of a further letter from the publisher, quoted by Longford, suggests that he had refused in the strongest language to submit to blackmail.","2024-02-29T11:40:24.882143+00:00","Wellesley was born into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family.",{"id":337,"name":338,"slug":339,"alternative_names":5,"description":5,"created_at":340,"gender":5,"language":5,"nationality":5,"ethnicity":5,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":8},340,"Duke of York","duke-of-york-340","2024-09-22T16:33:09.860974+00:00",{"id":342,"name":343,"slug":344,"alternative_names":345,"description":346,"created_at":347,"gender":48,"language":38,"nationality":39,"ethnicity":40,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":8},287,"Earl Brownlow","earl-brownlow-287","John Cust","The eldest son of the 1st Baron of Brownlow, elected MP for Clitheroe in 1802 after his tour of Russia and Germany in 1801.

In 1793 he was made prebendary of Canterbury, in 1799 dean of Gloucester, in 1800 rector of Taynton Gloucestershire and in 1806 exchanged St George the Martyr for St Andrew's in Holbourn. This trend of successive appointments continued as he was appointed bishop of Bristol in 1807, translated to Hereford the following year and in 1808 obtained the deanary of Gloucester. He held the archdeaconry of St Asaph at the same time as the bishopric of Bristol, earning his family rouhgly £27,000 in income from St Asaph and Hereford. After his death Luxmoore's family earned £7,000 from St Asaph and his son Charles Scott Luxmoore acted similarly, holding mutliple episcopal posts at once.

After training in Workington, Jonathan became a teacher, at St. Bees School and in 1759 went to Virginia, where he became a private tutor in the families of Virginia planters. Invited to become vicar of a nearby Anglican church, but lacking any religious qualifications, he briefly returned to England, to be ordained by the bishop of London in March 1762. He also carried a cane around the colony.He landed in America again on 12 July, was associated with the Anglican Church, and remained until 1775 as rector of various Virginia and Maryland parishes, including St. Mary's, Caroline County, Virginia, Hanover, King George County, Virginia, and St Anne's in Annapolis, Maryland and in 1771, St. Barnabas Church, Upper Marlboro, Maryland. He was widely known as an eloquent preacher, and his scholarly attainments won for him the friendship and esteem of some of the ablest scholars in the colonies. Boucher was an accomplished writer and scholar, contributed largely to William Hutchinson's History of the County of Cumberland (2 vols., 1794 seq.), and published A View of the Causes and Consequences of the American Revolution (1797), dedicated to General George Washington, and consisting of thirteen discourses delivered in America between 1763 and 1775. He married three times, first in America in 1772 to Eleanor Addison, of which little is known, other than that his wife did not appear to return to Britain with him; they had a daughter named Eleanor Boucher. His second marriage occurred in England in 1787 to Mary Elizabeth Foreman, who died the following year. His last marriage in 1789 was to Elizabeth James (née Hodgson), a widow to Dr. John James.

Watson and his wife Mary had two daughters, his wife was the daughter of a banker in the City of London. Although he spent a large portion of his life in the commercial world, Watson was dedicated to serving the Church of England through advocacy and charity. He was closely associated with the Hackney Phalanx and worked extensively throughout his life to extend charity to several religious and philanthropic causes. He was the first treasurer for the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church and is considered largely responsible for raising £16000 in subscriptions and the appointment of the archbishop of Canterbury as president. Watson and Henry Handley Norris bought the British Critic in 1811 using it to publish the principles of the church. From 1815 Watson retired and dedicated himself to philanthropy becoming tresurer of the Clergy Orphan Society, a govenor of the London Fever Hospital and on account of his good work recieved presents from the kings of Prussia and Saxony as well as a diploma of honour from the University of Hamburg. He aided in making the SPG more fiscally stable increasing its annual income from £8100 in 1814 to £82,000 by 1855. He was invested and encouraged missionary work especially the building of colonial churches where several of his close friends were appointed as bishops. The death of his wife in 1831, brother in 1839 and daughter in 1840 caused him deep distress, driving him to sell his Westminster house in 1840 and move in with his sister-in-law in Clapton.","2024-09-12T11:24:16.755365+00:00",{"id":845,"name":839,"slug":846,"alternative_names":5,"description":847,"created_at":848,"gender":48,"language":38,"nationality":39,"ethnicity":40,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":41},133,"joshua-watson-133","English wine merchant, philanthropist, a prominent member of the high church party and of several charitable organisations, who became known as \"the best layman in England\". Married Mary whose uncle was Charles Daubeney. Joshua from his early years was brought into contact with other members of the high-church party, of which he afterwards became the virtual leader. Among his early friends and advisers were William Stevens, the disciple and biographer of William Jones of Nayland, and founder of the Club of Nobody's Friends, of which Joshua Watson was an original member; Jonathan Boucher, who became in 1785 vicar of Epsom, where John James Watson had his first curacy; and Sir John Richardson (afterwards a judge in the court of common pleas), who had been a college friend of John James Watson.Among other friends were Henry Handley Norris, with whom he maintained an unbroken friendship of nearly sixty years, and William Van Mildert, rector of St. Mary-le-Bow in the city (afterwards bishop of Durham). Van Mildert submitted both his Boyle Lectures and his Bampton Lectures to Watson's revision, and was largely guided by his advice in literary matters. Nor was Van Mildert the only man of letters who showed confidence in his literary power. At the house of Van Mildert in Ely Place he met the elder Christopher Wordsworth, master of Trinity College, Cambridge, whom he joined in revising the proof-sheets of Christopher Wordsworth the younger's work, Theophilus Anglicanus. These men were, with Archdeacon Benjamin Harrison and William Rowe Lyall, Watson's chief friends and coadjutors. In 1814 Watson retired from business to devote himself exclusively to works of piety and charity. He never missed any meeting of the Society for Propagation of the Gospel, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, or the National Society, and his counsel was highly valued. He took a deep interest in the colonial church, being an intimate friend of Bishop Middleton of Calcutta, Bishop Inglis of Nova Scotia, Bishop Broughton of Australasia, and subsequently Bishop Selwyn of New Zealand. In 1814 he was appointed, together with his friend Archdeacon Cambridge, treasurer of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, which during his treasurership increased greatly its work and income. About the same time he became secretary of the relief fund for the German sufferers from the Napoleonic wars. In 1817 the Church Building Society, called at first the Church Room Society, was formed. Watson was largely instrumental in its foundation, drawing up the original resolution. This was quickly followed by a royal commission for church building issued under Lord Liverpool's government. Watson was one of the commissioners, and found the work so engrossing that in 1822 he took a house, No. 6 Park Street, Westminster, where he lived for sixteen years, to be near the scene of his labours.He was also treasurer of the Clergy Orphan School, which was, perhaps, of all his benevolent schemes, the one nearest to his heart.","2024-02-29T11:30:20.999889+00:00",{"id":850,"name":851,"slug":852,"alternative_names":5,"description":5,"created_at":853,"gender":5,"language":5,"nationality":5,"ethnicity":5,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":8},242,"J.P.

In 1828 he took a leading role in the repeal of the Test Acts which discriminated against Catholics and Protestant dissenters. He was one of the principal architects of the Reform Act 1832, which was the first major reform of Parliament since the Restoration, and a significant early step on the road to democracy and away from rule by the aristocracy and landed gentry. He favoured expanding the right to vote to the middle classes and enfranchising Britain's growing industrial towns and cities, but he never advocated universal suffrage and he opposed the secret ballot. Russell was outspoken on many issues over the course of his career, advocating Catholic emancipation in the 1820s, calling for the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1845, denouncing Pope Pius IX's revival of Catholic bishoprics in 1850, and supporting Italian unification during the 1860s. Russell's political agenda was frequently frustrated by his lack of a reliable Commons majority. However, his government was able to secure a number of notable social reforms. Russell introduced teachers' pensions and used Orders in Council to make grants for teacher training. The Public Baths and Wash-houses Acts of 1847 and 1848 enabled local authorities to build municipal baths and washing facilities for the growing urban working classes. Russell lent his support to the passage of the Factories Act 1847, which restricted the working hours of women and young persons (aged 13–18) in textile mills to 10 hours per day.Russell married Adelaide Lister (widow of Thomas Lister, 2nd Baron Ribblesdale, who had died in 1832) on 11 April 1835.

In 1780, Sheridan entered the House of Commons as the ally of Charles James Fox on the side of the American Colonials in the political debate of that year. He is said to have paid the burgesses of Stafford five guineas apiece to allow him to represent them. As a consequence, his first speech in Parliament was a defence against the charge of bribery.He held the posts of Receiver-General of the Duchy of Cornwall (1804–1807) and Treasurer of the Navy (1806–1807). Sheridan was noted for his close political relationship with the Prince of Wales, leading a faction of his supporters in the Commons. By 1805 when the Prince was cooling on his previous support of Catholic Emancipation Sheridan, George Tierney and others announced their own opposition to it.[22]\n\nWhen, after 32 years in Parliament, he lost re-election in 1812, his creditors closed in on him and his last years were harassed by debt and disappointment. On hearing of his debts, the American Congress offered Sheridan £20,000 in recognition of his efforts to prevent the American War of Independence. He refused the offer.

He is remembered especially for the poem \"After Blenheim\" and the original version of \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\". In some respects, Southey was ahead of his time in his views on social reform. For example, he was an early critic of the evils the new factory system brought to early 19th-century Britain. He was appalled by the living conditions in towns like Birmingham and Manchester and especially by employment of children in factories and outspoken about them. He sympathised with the pioneering socialist plans of Robert Owen, advocated that the state promotes public works to maintain high employment, and called for universal education.","2024-02-29T12:34:55.57813+00:00",{"id":1226,"name":1227,"slug":1228,"alternative_names":5,"description":1229,"created_at":1230,"gender":48,"language":38,"nationality":39,"ethnicity":5,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":89},199,"Roger Swire","roger-swire-199","Roger Swire was born in Manfield, Yorkshire, and studied Military Science for two years at King's.

He is regarded as the father of modern British policing, owing to his founding of the Metropolitan Police Service. Peel was one of the founders of the modern Conservative Party.The son of a wealthy textile manufacturer and politician, Peel was the first prime minister from an industrial business background. He earned a double first in classics and mathematics from Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the House of Commons in 1809 and became a rising star in the Tory Party. Peel entered the Cabinet as home secretary (1822–1827), where he reformed and liberalised the criminal law and created the modern police force, leading to a new type of officer known in tribute to him as \"bobbies\" and \"peelers\". After a brief period out of office he returned as home secretary under his political mentor the Duke of Wellington (1828–1830), also serving as Leader of the House of Commons. Initially, a supporter of continued legal discrimination against Catholics, Peel reversed himself and supported the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 and the 1828 repeal of the Test Act, claiming that \"though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger\".Peel often started from a traditional Tory position in opposition to a measure, then reversed his stance and became the leader in supporting liberal legislation. This happened with the Test Act, Catholic emancipation, the Reform Act, income tax and, most notably, the repeal of the Corn Laws. Historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote: \"Peel was in the first rank of 19th-century statesmen. He carried Catholic Emancipation; he repealed the Corn Laws; he created the modern Conservative Party on the ruins of the old Toryism. Peel was born at Chamber Hall, Bury, Lancashire, to the industrialist and parliamentarian Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, and his wife Ellen Yates. His father was one of the richest textile manufacturers of the early Industrial Revolution. Peel received his early education from a clergyman tutor in Bury and at a clergyman's local school in Tamworth.He may also have attended Bury Grammar School or Hipperholme Grammar School, though evidence for either is anecdotal rather than textual. He started at Harrow School in February 1800. At Harrow, he was a contemporary of Lord Byron. Attended Christ Church, Oxford, which Peel attended 1805–1808, graduating with a double first. In 1805, Peel matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. His tutor was Charles Lloyd, later Regius Professor of Divinity, on Peel's recommendation appointed bishop of Oxford. In 1808 Peel became the first Oxford student to take a double first in Classics and Mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","2024-02-29T11:50:24.825531+00:00",{"id":1283,"name":1284,"slug":1285,"alternative_names":5,"description":1286,"created_at":1287,"gender":48,"language":38,"nationality":39,"ethnicity":40,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":41},132,"Sir William Weller Pepys","sir-william-weller-pepys-132","2nd Baron Pepys, was a lawyer who became Master in Chancery.

Cotton was a merchant, inventor, banker, and philanthropist, who during his lifetime built numerous churches and schools for the working classes. Cotton came from a well-established upper middle-class family. His father (Joseph Cotton, 1745-1825) had made his money as a captain for the East India Company (EIC) taking advantage of expanding imperial trade and was later appointed a director of the EIC. His grandfather (Dr Nathaniel Cotton, 1705-1788) was a highly respected physician.  Cotton was a deeply religious man and during his lifetime was involved with societies such as the Colonial Bishoprics Fund, Hackney Phalanx of Prominent Churchmen and Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. Cotton believed that moral reform was the best form of patriotism. Importantly, he argued that the poor needed to be relieved of their poverty before their morals could be judged. His philanthropy therefore focused on the promotion of institutions that could relieve economic and social pressures. This included his zeal for building churches, promoting public baths, wash houses and model lodging houses.  \n\nHowever, Cotton’s behaviour was not always so exemplary. During his time at Chigwell Grammar, 15-year-old Cotton was accused of setting fire to the headmaster’s garden. Cotton married Sarah Fowler in 1812. The couple had seven children together and Cotton maintained a keen interest in their upbringing and education. Reflecting both his business shrewdness and his familial shipping legacy, Cotton first began his career at the Limehouse shipping firm Huddart & Co. which he later adopted full control of, he also invented steam driven rope making machinery and in 1851 was awarded the Telford Medal from the Institution of Civil Engineers. During his tenure at the Bank of England, Cotton alongside Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel and Conservative plantation owner, Henry Goulburn, produced the Bank Charter Act of 1844. One of his most valued inventions was an automatic weighing machine for sovereigns, colloquially referred to as ‘the governor’, which won a medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and was used extensively at the Bank of England. William Cotton became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1821, was elected chairman of the London Hospital in 1827 and became treasurer in 1837 echoing some of the roles he undertook for the newly founded King’s College London in 1829. He also used the many connections he made through these roles to fundraise for King’s College London. However, the man he had the most contact with at King’s was his friend Henry Nelson Coleridge, who was also an important council member. Cotton was described by historian Hearnshaw as a ‘venerable member’ of King’s and one whose death in 1866 marked ‘the first age of the college’ coming to an end.","2024-03-21T11:22:08.076963+00:00",{"id":1409,"name":1410,"slug":1411,"alternative_names":5,"description":5,"created_at":1412,"gender":5,"language":5,"nationality":5,"ethnicity":5,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":8},291,"William Gifford","william-gifford-291","2024-09-11T15:10:38.603134+00:00",{"id":1414,"name":1415,"slug":1416,"alternative_names":5,"description":5,"created_at":492,"gender":48,"language":38,"nationality":39,"ethnicity":5,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":95},270,"William Hay Chapman","william-hay-chapman-270",{"id":1418,"name":1419,"slug":1420,"alternative_names":5,"description":5,"created_at":1421,"gender":5,"language":5,"nationality":5,"ethnicity":5,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":8},316,"William Henry Cholmondeley","william-henry-cholmondeley-316","2024-09-21T16:45:54.418202+00:00",{"id":1423,"name":1424,"slug":1425,"alternative_names":5,"description":5,"created_at":1426,"gender":5,"language":5,"nationality":5,"ethnicity":5,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":8},350,"William Hill","william-hill-350","2024-09-23T15:44:14.570847+00:00",{"id":1428,"name":1429,"slug":1430,"alternative_names":1431,"description":1432,"created_at":1433,"gender":48,"language":38,"nationality":39,"ethnicity":40,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":7,"added_by":8},342,"William Howley","william-howley-342","Right Hon.

He increased taxes to pay for the great war against France and cracked down on radicalism. To engage the threat of Irish support for France, he engineered the Acts of Union 1800 and tried (but failed) to secure Catholic emancipation as part of the Union.

A native of Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, and became an independent Member of Parliament (MP) for Yorkshire (1784–1812). In 1785, he underwent a conversion experience and became an Evangelical Anglican, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform.In 1787, Wilberforce came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of activists against the slave trade, including Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he became a leading English abolitionist. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for 20 years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807.Wilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice, British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, the foundation of the Church Mission Society and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially repressive legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad.In later years, Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire. Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt the Younger. Attended Hull Grammar School, which at the time was headed by a young, dynamic headmaster, Joseph Milner, who was to become a lifelong friend. In October 1776, at the age of seventeen, Wilberforce went up to St John's College, Cambridge.In October 1784, Wilberforce embarked upon a tour of Europe which would ultimately change his life and determine his future career. He travelled with his mother and sister in the company of Isaac Milner, the brilliant younger brother of his former headmaster, who had been Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, in the year when Wilberforce first went up.
