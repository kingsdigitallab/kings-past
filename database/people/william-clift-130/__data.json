Had a talent for illustrating. Taken on as an unpaid apprentice in the Hunter museum. Clift achieved respect and popularity within the scientific community of his time. Dr. South spoke of him as 'a kindly-hearted creature, always ready to impart and not to appropriate information,' and with a 'head crammed full of knowledge.'[citation needed] Benjamin Brodie the elder praised his industry and his thirst for the acquisition of knowledge, his sagacity and keen observation. He was esteemed by Sir Joseph Banks, Dr. Wollaston, Sir Humphry Davy.
