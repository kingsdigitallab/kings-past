Like the other Lake Poets, William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Southey began as a radical but became steadily more conservative as he gained respect for Britain and its institutions. Other romantics such as Byron accused him of siding with the establishment for money and status. He is remembered especially for the poem \"After Blenheim\" and the original version of \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\". In some respects, Southey was ahead of his time in his views on social reform. For example, he was an early critic of the evils the new factory system brought to early 19th-century Britain. He was appalled by the living conditions in towns like Birmingham and Manchester and especially by employment of children in factories and outspoken about them. He sympathised with the pioneering socialist plans of Robert Owen, advocated that the state promotes public works to maintain high employment, and called for universal education.","2024-02-29T12:34:55.57813+00:00","English","United Kingdom","White",true,"Gillian Lamb"],"uses":{"params":["source","slug"]}}]}
