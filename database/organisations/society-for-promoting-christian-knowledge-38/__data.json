As the British Empire grew in the 19th century, SPCK supported the planting of new churches around the world. Funds were provided for church buildings, schools, theological training colleges, and to provide chaplains for the ships taking emigrants to their new homes.From the late 1800s to the early 20th century, SPCK ran a Training College for Lay Workers on Commercial Road in Stepney Green, London.hroughout the 18th century, SPCK was by far the largest producer of Christian literature in Britain.[citation needed] The range of its output was considerable - from pamphlets aimed at specific groups such as farmers, prisoners, soldiers, seamen, servants and slave-owners, to more general works on subjects such as baptism, confirmation, Holy Communion, the Prayer Book, and private devotion. Increasingly, more substantial books were also published, both on Christian subjects and, from the 1830s, on general educational topics as well. \u003C/p>\n",[],[],[],[22,34,43,51,61,70,79,88],{"id":23,"name":24,"slug":25,"alternative_names":8,"description":26,"created_at":27,"gender":28,"language":29,"nationality":30,"ethnicity":31,"ethnicity_description":8,"nationality_description":8,"draft":13,"added_by":14,"person_member_of":32},108,"Archdeacon Cambridge","archdeacon-cambridge-108","Part of Hackney Phalanx of High Church Men#","2024-02-29T10:28:55.238724+00:00","Assigned male at birth","English","United Kingdom","White",[33],{"organisation":7},{"id":35,"name":36,"slug":37,"alternative_names":38,"description":8,"created_at":39,"gender":28,"language":29,"nationality":30,"ethnicity":8,"ethnicity_description":8,"nationality_description":8,"draft":13,"added_by":40,"person_member_of":41},251,"Henry Ryder","henry-ryder-251","Right Hon.
