Rev. Dr. Lord Bishop of St. Davids","Jenkinson was brother to Charles Jenkinson first earl of Liverpool, colonel in the army, joint secretary for Ireland and gentleman usher to Queen Charlotte. John Jenkinson graduated Oxford in 1804 with a BA, an MA in 1807 and DD in 1817. His episcopal career began when he was made prebendary of Worcester in 1808 then rector of Leverington in 1812, dean of Worcester in 1818 and master of St Oswalds, Worcester in 1818. By 1825 he was elected bishop of St. David’s and a month later in August made canon of Durham - worth £9,000 annually to him and his family. Having abstained from the first vote on Catholic emancipation, by 1829 he had shifted to accepting the relief bill. Jenkinson was involved with the foundation of both Durham University as well as King's College London. He maintained a school in Carmarthen for children from poor families. His eldest son inherited Charles Jenkinson's title becoming eleventh baronet of Liverpool in 1855.

He is regarded as the father of modern British policing, owing to his founding of the Metropolitan Police Service. Peel was one of the founders of the modern Conservative Party.The son of a wealthy textile manufacturer and politician, Peel was the first prime minister from an industrial business background. He earned a double first in classics and mathematics from Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the House of Commons in 1809 and became a rising star in the Tory Party. Peel entered the Cabinet as home secretary (1822–1827), where he reformed and liberalised the criminal law and created the modern police force, leading to a new type of officer known in tribute to him as \"bobbies\" and \"peelers\". After a brief period out of office he returned as home secretary under his political mentor the Duke of Wellington (1828–1830), also serving as Leader of the House of Commons. Initially, a supporter of continued legal discrimination against Catholics, Peel reversed himself and supported the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 and the 1828 repeal of the Test Act, claiming that \"though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger\".Peel often started from a traditional Tory position in opposition to a measure, then reversed his stance and became the leader in supporting liberal legislation. This happened with the Test Act, Catholic emancipation, the Reform Act, income tax and, most notably, the repeal of the Corn Laws. Historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote: \"Peel was in the first rank of 19th-century statesmen. He carried Catholic Emancipation; he repealed the Corn Laws; he created the modern Conservative Party on the ruins of the old Toryism. Peel was born at Chamber Hall, Bury, Lancashire, to the industrialist and parliamentarian Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, and his wife Ellen Yates. His father was one of the richest textile manufacturers of the early Industrial Revolution. Peel received his early education from a clergyman tutor in Bury and at a clergyman's local school in Tamworth.He may also have attended Bury Grammar School or Hipperholme Grammar School, though evidence for either is anecdotal rather than textual. He started at Harrow School in February 1800. At Harrow, he was a contemporary of Lord Byron. Attended Christ Church, Oxford, which Peel attended 1805–1808, graduating with a double first. In 1805, Peel matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. His tutor was Charles Lloyd, later Regius Professor of Divinity, on Peel's recommendation appointed bishop of Oxford.

His friend Cyril Jackson, who was the head of his Oxford College, significantly stengthened his application to become headmaster of Westminster where he became well-liked despite the consensus pointing toward a tacit endorsement of fighting. The post of sub-almoner to the King was given to him in 1808 and in 1809 the prebend of Westminster.
