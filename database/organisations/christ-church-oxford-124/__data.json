This trajectory continued as by 1820 he was archbishop of Dublin and privy councillor of Ireland. Finally, he was translated to the archbishopric of Armagh and the primacy of all Ireland in 1822, his diocese was combined in 1850, after the death of the bishop of Clogher, with the former. He spent a significant proportion of his income on charitable services such as erecting a £3000 belltower on the University of Dublin campus and £6000 to St Columba College which was intended to perform the same function as Eaton College for the Irish gentry. He was against the catholic emancipation.

In 1782 Crewe's Act was passed barring revenue officers from participating in parliamentary elections. He was a keen supporter both politically and financially of Charles James Fox going into opposition with him in 1783. In 1773 he took on £1200 in annuity on Fox's behalf and spent each year roughly £12,000 to support Fox. In 1784 he led the counterattack on a crowd attempting to break the windows of Fox's house and in 1806 was awarded a peerage for his steadfast support. He and his wife Frances had a happy marriage with four children, two boys and two girls. Frances was a noted beauty and political hostess well-liked by members of Fox's party.

His translation to the bishopric of Oxford was initially rejected until the Duke of Wellington convinced him it would not be a stressful position, this advice did not prove true. Sixteen years later after being thrust at the center of the Oxford movement he pleaded for Sir Robert Peel to be translated elsewhere.

He is regarded as the father of modern British policing, owing to his founding of the Metropolitan Police Service. Peel was one of the founders of the modern Conservative Party.The son of a wealthy textile manufacturer and politician, Peel was the first prime minister from an industrial business background. He earned a double first in classics and mathematics from Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the House of Commons in 1809 and became a rising star in the Tory Party. Peel entered the Cabinet as home secretary (1822–1827), where he reformed and liberalised the criminal law and created the modern police force, leading to a new type of officer known in tribute to him as \"bobbies\" and \"peelers\". After a brief period out of office he returned as home secretary under his political mentor the Duke of Wellington (1828–1830), also serving as Leader of the House of Commons. Initially, a supporter of continued legal discrimination against Catholics, Peel reversed himself and supported the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 and the 1828 repeal of the Test Act, claiming that \"though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger\".Peel often started from a traditional Tory position in opposition to a measure, then reversed his stance and became the leader in supporting liberal legislation. This happened with the Test Act, Catholic emancipation, the Reform Act, income tax and, most notably, the repeal of the Corn Laws. Historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote: \"Peel was in the first rank of 19th-century statesmen. He carried Catholic Emancipation; he repealed the Corn Laws; he created the modern Conservative Party on the ruins of the old Toryism. Peel was born at Chamber Hall, Bury, Lancashire, to the industrialist and parliamentarian Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, and his wife Ellen Yates. His father was one of the richest textile manufacturers of the early Industrial Revolution. Peel received his early education from a clergyman tutor in Bury and at a clergyman's local school in Tamworth.He may also have attended Bury Grammar School or Hipperholme Grammar School, though evidence for either is anecdotal rather than textual. He started at Harrow School in February 1800. At Harrow, he was a contemporary of Lord Byron. Attended Christ Church, Oxford, which Peel attended 1805–1808, graduating with a double first. In 1805, Peel matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. His tutor was Charles Lloyd, later Regius Professor of Divinity, on Peel's recommendation appointed bishop of Oxford. In 1808 Peel became the first Oxford student to take a double first in Classics and Mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","2024-02-29T11:50:24.825531+00:00","Gillian Lamb",[78],{"organisation":4},{"id":80,"name":81,"slug":82,"alternative_names":83,"description":84,"created_at":85,"gender":24,"language":25,"nationality":26,"ethnicity":27,"ethnicity_description":5,"nationality_description":5,"draft":9,"added_by":10,"person_member_of":86},338,"William Carey","william-carey-338","Rt.

His friend Cyril Jackson, who was the head of his Oxford College, significantly stengthened his application to become headmaster of Westminster where he became well-liked despite the consensus pointing toward a tacit endorsement of fighting. The post of sub-almoner to the King was given to him in 1808 and in 1809 the prebend of Westminster. He was placed in charge by the duke of York of educating the children of soldiers at the Royal Military Asylum in Chelsea.
