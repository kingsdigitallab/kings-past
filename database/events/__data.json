IX, 1833)\nThe aim was to exploit recent advances in printing and distribution by publishing cheap, informative works to “supply the appetite which had been created by elementary instruction” (through infants’ schools and mechanics’ institutes) and to “direct the ability to read to useful ends”, as the Whig MP Thomas Spring Rice declared at a meeting of the Society in 1828 (The Times, 19 May 1828)\nIt was agreed that the Society’s publications in its Library of Useful Knowledge would avoid party politics and religion, in order to appeal to the widest audience and also to avoid controversy among its members, who represented a broad spread of religious affiliation, from non-believers to liberal Anglicans and dissenters of various kinds\nDespite this precaution, the Society attracted negative attention from Tories and Church of England commentators\nThis was because its founders were well-known for other activities on behalf of political and educational reform\nMany were prominent members of the Council of the new University of London (later University College London), founded in 1825 and preparing to open in October 1828 to teach students of all faiths and none, who were prevented from graduating at Oxford and Cambridge because they were not confessing
